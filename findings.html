				<h2>Preference for Rock</h2>
                <p>
                    The Top 10 Genres per Year Streamgraph shows that since late 60's, people have put Rock as the
                    preferred genre among all. This can also be noticed on the map where the green color, which
                    represents Rock, is predominant among other.

                <p>
                    Other interesting fact is the amount of rock artists in London and California which are the regions
                    with more overlapping circles in the map.

                        The undirected force graph shows us how many of the top ten artists per decade are related by
                        the Rock genre. Surprisingly, almost every artist is related to it but this seems not to be
                        totally true. For instance, Aretha Franklin, a soul, R&B and gospel singer from the 60's is not
                        known for singing rock songs; this makes us suspect that the data from the APIs may not be
                        100% reliable.

                        <img src="./resources/findings/findings-aretha.PNG" alt="forcegraph rock">
                        Wikipedia classifies Aretha Franklin's music in the following genres: Gospel, R&B, Jazz, Soul
                        and Pop. However, data from Echonest and Spotify also relate her to Country, Rock, Funk,
                        Soundtrack, Disco and Motown.

                <h2>Top artists with no top ten genres</h2>

                            Even though Skrillex shares many popular genres with many other artists, he is the only one
                            who have Dubstep as his main genre between the top 10 artists.

                <h2>Top artists mainly from North America and Europe</h2>
                <P>Besides from an australian band, top popular artists are centralized to Europe and North America.
                    This fact is interesting as the countries with more population are located in Asia. For instance,
                    Psy with his video Gangman Style got more than 2,147,483,647 views on YouTube.
